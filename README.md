## Introduction

This is the 1st party web client of the attoly platform. Attoly allows creating short links as aliases for
long URLs, which are easier to embed in websites, chats and documents. This React based single page
application provides the user with a user-friendly interface to operate the platform. Originally, the Attoly
Platform is a learning project to gain experience in distributed systems, user management, and cloud deployment.
Therefore there are no claims to maintenance, freedom from errors or further development. Further development
only occurs as part of the learning process.
